# Week8
I created a ghost-catching game "Ghostbusters" using mouse movements. 

At first, I draw prototype in figma

And I will explain the detail game. 
The sound.mp3 file serves as the game's background music and plays in a loop.
When you click the game start button, the game begins.

The wand always follows the mouse's movement using the easing() function. 
Ghosts appear randomly and roam freely within the canvas.

If you click on a ghost with the mouse (wand), the ghost dies, a sound effect plays, and the score increases by +1.

When the score reaches 10 points, the game ends with a sound effect and a "Success" message.

After the game ends, a restart button appears. 
When the user clicks the button, the game resets, allowing them to start again from the beginning.
